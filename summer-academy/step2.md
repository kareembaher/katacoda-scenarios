In this step we are going to run the Dockerfile to build our image

In this image we will add the hello-world application in it and we will expose a port so you can check it out and see the results yourself

Execute `docker build -name summer-academy-hello-world.`{{execute}} to build your image

Now you can see the built image through this command `docker images | grep summer-academy-hello-world`{{execute}}
