In this step, we will add a stage to run the image we made in the previous one

Add the following stage:


```
stage('Run docker container') {
  steps {
    sh 'docker run --rm  -d -p 80:8000 django-blog'
  }
}
```


Now lets Run the pipeline and test the stages you made.

Now check your container if its running by executing `docker ps`{{execute}}

If it passed, proceed with the next step, if not please troubleshoot and test again.

Lets now access this URL to check the application on port `80`  [ACCESS PORTS]({{TRAFFIC_SELECTOR}})
