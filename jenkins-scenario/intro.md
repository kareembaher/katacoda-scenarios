In this scenario you'll learn how to configure Jenkins to build Docker Images based on a Dockerfile. The scenario is designed to demostrate how you can use Docker within a CI/CD pipeline, using Images as a build artefact that can be promoted to different environments and finally production.


In this scenario you will run a Django application written in Python language.

So first, you will install and configure Jenkins to make a pipeline.

Then, you will install some plugins to help you in our pipline to run our application.

After that, you will make the pipeline and add different stages with different tasks.

Finally, you will check our running application and see how well you did ;).
